## *Matiboux.com* - Backup Public Repository

**Welcome.**  
**My name is Mathieu "Matiboux" Gu√©rin.**  
You could see me as a young web developer.  
But I'm also a web designer and a little artist who draws mostly furries, and wish he could make some music or simple melodies.

In few words, I'm a random kid like anyone. I'm just curious.  
What makes me special is that I tried so many things, even if I suck at most of them. Here's what I tried in my short life.

- I play videos games a lot. I tried to make some but I wasn't working on them hard enough.  
*Side note: Videos games are why I became a developer.*
- I tried to work on [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) robots, and also with [Processing](https://processing.org/).  
*Side note: I enjoyed Processing a lot because of its "creativity speed". I could create and then see what I made become real in only few seconds.*
- I tried to make few Minecraft and Gmod servers. I was too lonely to be able to make them grow up so I quickly gave up.
- Then I started to make websites, *and I really enjoyed it, for the same reasons as why I liked Processing*. I started with basic HTML/CSS, then PHP, then JavaScript/jQuery.  
I started to make few projects on the web all by myself: with a computer, a basic and empty PHP web server I rent, some documentations and my lil' hands.
- I learnt how to draw by my own. Watching others' artwork and trying to be as good as I could. I really enjoyed - and still now - the furry fandom so that's what I'm trying to draw: furries.
- I tried to make musics on FL Studio. It really sucks. I don't take much time to learn how to properly use it tho..
- And I wrote stories.. Most of them about my own feelings. Heh.

And today, I decided to take a break from my projects which mean that my web projects are on standy. That's why I upload a backup here.

So that's it about me.
Enjoy my website backup here, or check the list of all my projects below.
